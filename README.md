## Notes
### Date
October 26th 2021
### Location of deployed application
N/A
### Time spent
Including installing/setting up software, 14 hours
### Assumptions made
The code was complete and only needed to be packaged
Ruby and Postgresql had to be installed
### Shortcuts/Compromises made
Everything would have to be better in a real-world application. However, I would have leveraged the knowledge of my team in a real-world situation
### Stretch goals attempted
Did not attempt stretch goals as I was unable to complete the basic test
### Instructions to run assignment locally
N/A
### What did you not include in your solution that you want us to know about?
N/A
### Other information about your submission that you feel it's important that we know if applicable.
I have no experience with Ruby, Docker or Postgresql so had to start from scratch
### Your feedback on this technical challenge
While I understand it is important to get an insight into a candidates level with your tech stack, it may be more beneficial to provide different tests based on the candidate's experience with other languages in order to see if they can work through the required steps.
